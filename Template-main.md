### Template Body



>Instructions: Complete any of the following LA template sections below that contribute to the understanding, definition and implementation of your new working branch. Each section has a set of questions that may be used or expanded as needed. The sample questions listed below meet a common criteria in that they have a potential relationship to be considered or an impact on the practice of agile scrum.   


#### 1) Leadership Structures

| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
| Will you use a scrum-as-a-service model? Will all scrum master be considered full-time dedicated to their teams or will their be more than one commitment level to supported teams and projects? If so, will such tiers be based on project complexity, time, resources, other? | | 
| Will the scrum master reporting vertical be the same as the scrum teams reporting vertical?   |  |
|What relationship will the scrum team have with the PMO? | | 
|Will this method have a greater bias of the scrum master working with the project manager, product manager, or both equally?
|Will devops have scrum masters? | | 
|Will you have a scrum master RACI grid  | |
|Will one or more of your scrum master positions also fill a Jira system admin role or will Jira admin role belong to devops? | | 



#### 2) Change Management
| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
|Will there be a change management tool for use when a scrum process is changed?  | | 
|Will there be a goal of cross-team scrum standardization and practice, and if so how will such changes be managed? | | 
|Will scrum master play any role in ensuring policy or SDLC in software development (ISO compliance)? | | 
|Will safety trials be used to first validate cross-team scrum configuration changes before implementation? | | 


#### 3) Documentation
| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
| What activity, if any, will scrum masters and or scrum teams have with documentation? | |
|What participation, if any, will scrum masters have with release documentation? | |
| Will scrum masters be responsible for any end of sprint documentation or records?| |
| | | 

#### 4) Scrum Architecture
| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
|What methods, if any, will be used to scale the organization? | (e.g. SAFe, LeSS, PMO,..)| 
|Will scrum teams be working with PM's and if so, how? | | 
|Will PM's and scrum teams use common work types in tracking and communication? | | 
|Will PM's work with scrum master and if so, what tool configurations might aid in that alignment? | | 
|Who owns Jira system and product administration? | | 
|What issue types will scrum teams be using | | 
|What PMO project mapping tiers will be used? | (e.g. Portfolio, Program,..) |
|Will all teams be using a common sprint start and stop and if so, how wide is the window? | | 
|Will your scrum teams us project-based board, skill set board, domain boards, SME based boards? | | 
|Will SMs be working/trained as project board curators? If not, what does a typical user story origination and life cycle look like? | |
|Will organization scrum boards be configured for through-lines? | |  
|Will you scrum master or scrum architect be adjust the issue tracking tool to reflect the version control and or branching strategy? Will continuous integration or continous delivery be a consideration in scrum architecture? Will your team use a hotfix branch, feature branch,others? | | 
| Will your teams use releases (versus CI/CD)? | | 
| Will there be controls or governance that place requirements on when scrum architecture can be changed? | | 




#### 5) Reporting
| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
|Will sprint reporting be used? If so, in what ways. | | 
|If sprint reporting is used, what effort(s) if any will be taken to encourage fundamentally similar measured environments and suited for comparison of reporting metrics?  | | 
|Is auditing a concern of this LA branch and if so in what way? | | 
|Who owns the integrity of reporting and is this ownership free of conflict of interest? | | 
|Will reporting be part of an effort to improve or maintain project transparency? | | 




#### 6) Forecasting
| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
|Does this branch use forecasting, projections, neither, both, other? | |
|What roles or business units are potential consumers of this branches approach to forecasts and or projections? | |
|What scrum architecture configurations, if any, will support forecasting and or projections? | |
|What units of measure are used in forecasts and or projections? Will it include points, hours, or other relative units of work?| | 
|If story point estimation is used, will there be a scale such as Fibonacci or another approach? | |
| | | 






#### 7) Cost Accounting
| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
|Is this branch concerned with scrum or SDLC cost accounting? | |
|If so, what roles and organizations are consumers of that data? | |
|If so, who or what team is responsible for the integrety of the cost accounting | | 
| If so what teams or departments (i.e. PMO) might partner in this effort? | | 
|If cost accounting, what is the unit of measure?  | |
|If cost accounting, will scrum architecture be modified to support it? | |
