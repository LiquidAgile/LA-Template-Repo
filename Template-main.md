### Template Body



>Instructions: Complete any of the following LA template sections below that contribute to the definition and implementation of this working branch. Each section has a set of sample questions that may be used or expanded as needed.  


#### 1) Leadership Structures

| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
| Will you use a scrum-as-a-service model with multiple support options for your projects and teams? | | 
| Will the scrum master reporting vertical be the same as the scrum teams reporting vertical?   |  |
|What relationship will the scrum team have with the PMO? | | 
|Will devops have scrum masters? | | 
|Will you have a scrum master RACI grid  | |
| | | 



#### 2) Change Management
| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
|Will there be a change management tool for use when a scrum process is changed?  | | 
|Will there be a goal of cross-team scrum standardization and practice, and if so how will such changes be managed? | | 
|Will scrum master play any role in ensuring policy or SDLC in software development (ISO compliance)? | | 
|Will safety trials be used to first validate cross-team scrum configuration changes before implementation? | | 


#### 3) Documentation
| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
| What activity, if any, will scrum masters and or scrum teams have with documentation? | |
|What participation, if any, will scrum masters have with release documentation? | |
| Will scrum masters be responsible for any end of sprint documentation or records?| |
| | | 

#### 4) Scrum Architecture
| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
|What methods, if any, will be used to scale the organization? | (e.g. SAFe, LeSS, PMO,..)| 
|Will scrum teams be working with PM's and if so, how? | | 
|Will PM's and scrum teams use common work types in tracking and communication? | | 
|Will PM's work with scrum master and if so, what tool configurations might aid in that alignment? | | 
|Who owns Jira system and product administration? | | 
|What issue types will scrum teams be using | | 
|What PMO project mapping tiers will be used? | (e.g. Portfolio, Program,..) |
|Will all teams be using a common sprint start and stop and if so, how wide is the window? | | 
|Will your scrum teams us project-based board, skill set board, domain boards, SME based boards? | | 
|Will SMs be working/trained as project board curators? If not, what does a typical user story origination and life cycle look like? | |
|Will organization scrum boards be configured for through-lines? | |  


#### 5) Reporting
| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
|Will sprint reporting be used? If so, in what ways. | | 
|If sprint reporting is used, what effort(s) if any will be taken to encourage fundamentally similar measured environments and suited for comparison of reporting metrics?  | | 
|Is auditing a concern of this LA branch and if so in what way? | | 
|Who owns the integrity of reporting and is this ownership free of conflict of interest? | | 
|Will reporting be part of an effort to improve or maintain project transparency? | | 




#### 6) Forecasting
| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
|Does this branch use forecasting, projections, neither, both, other? | |
|What roles or business units are potential consumers of this branches approach to forecasts and or projections? | |
|What scrum architecture configurations, if any, will support forecasting and or projections? | |
|What units of measure are used in forecasts and or projections? Will it include points, hours, or other relative units of work?| | 
|If story point estimation is used, will there be a scale such as Fibonacci or another approach? | |
| | | 






#### 7) Cost Accounting
| Considerations & Question | Comment |
|-------|---------|
|Is this branch concerned with scrum or SDLC cost accounting? | |
|If so, what roles and organizations are consumers of that data? | |
|If so, who or what team is responsible for the integrety of the cost accounting | | 
| If so what teams or departments (i.e. PMO) might partner in this effort? | | 
|If cost accounting, what is the unit of measure?  | |
|If cost accounting, will scrum architecture be modified to support it? | |
