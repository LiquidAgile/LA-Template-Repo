### Read Me Doc

> _Liquid Agile is a managerial template for IT and PMO Directors engaged in enterprise scrum. It is based on the idea that different organizations, leaders, and teams, have ever-evolving needs and approaches to agile scrum. It is from this state that individual leaders share how they approach agile scrum by publishing an outline of their method. This space welcomes your outlines, and ideas on what you have found to work along your leadership journey. Next step, outline your own method in the form of a github branch and and add it to the LA repository._

#### Context
- Agile is 'an ability...'
- Scrum is 'a framework...' 
- LA is 'a template, for all of the above'

When a director, leader, academic, or scrum practitioner completes the LA template and publishes their branch here on GitHub that branch becomes available for peer review, discussion, and for the greater community to use. The inverse is also true in that you may benefit from those authors and their branches by creating your own sub-branch that accounts for your own specific needs. Although, not a requirement, it is courteous that working sub-branches be published under the branch that influenced them. 
The Github Issues link is one method of opening discussion with a branch or sub-branch author. The result is that a publish branches potentially becomes vetted, endorsed, critiqued (good and the bad) in ways that add to their potential resiliance and value. 

#### Summary of (LA)
Liquid Agile (LA) is an agile leadership template maintained on this GitHub repo and site page. LA is not a recommendation or instruction on how to practice enterprise scrum, but rather a repository of individual approaches (branches) to integrating scrum with IT, PMO, and other domains of corporate partnership.  

 The LA template is a file named 'Template-main' and lists seven bullet points that may be used as a starting place to describe and share a directors approach to agile scrum within a known use-case or example organization. 

To whatever extent a director, consultant, or leader addresses, interprets, or applies the sections of the template, they become an author of an academic or working branch of liquid agile posted on GitHub. That branch may be private to your own organization, your local desktop, or published here (see how to below) which results in a publicly shared managerial strategy.   

There are currently two types of publicaly shared branches, academic and working. The distinction is made by the branch author when completing the template. Academnic branches have not been in enterprise use and working branches have been or are in enterprise use. 


#### How To Submit Your Own Branch
There are multipe ways to create a branch. For those comfortable with version control systems such as GIT, you can clone the repo to your local machine and edit as you wish. The file and content is yours to do with as you wish, you can manage privately or you can do a pull request to get your branch published on the public GitHub LA repo. 

Another approach is to open Template-main file in your browser using the built in Github tools and then click edit to see the download options. 

Last but not least, you can engage a real person to assist. That real person engagement can be done by clicking on Issues link above for public questions, chatting on this Twitter link, or this support email contact.  

 

#### Working Branch Example
LA Matterhorn is a github published working branch that may be helpful to use as a reference for ideas as you construct your own branch.
