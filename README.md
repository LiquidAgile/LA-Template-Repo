> _Liquid Agile is a managerial template for IT and PMO Directors engaged in enterprise scrum. It is based on the idea that different organizations, leaders, and teams, have ever-evolving needs, and approaches to agile scrum. This space welcomes your ideas, your experiments, your kind support of your peers while steering your own journey. This repo has a standing invitation open to all agile scrum thought leaders to share their leadership approach to agile scrum. Next step, have your branch added to the LA repository__

##### Context
- Agile is 'an ability...'
- Scrum is 'a framework...' 
- LA is 'a template, for all of the above'

When a director, leader, academic, or scrum practitioner completes the LA template and publishes their own branch, they become an author of a branch (e.g. LA working branch). If that branch is published here on GitHub then peer review is welcome and becomes available through the native tools of Github. A branch potentially becomes vetted, endorsed, criticed (good and the bad) to become better. All of which is to be done with the mindset of sharing, helping others, and continuously improving a complex leadership responsibility that we all work in everyday. 

##### Summary of (LA)
Liquid Agile (LA) is an agile leadership template maintained on this GitHub site. LA is not a recommendation or instruction on how to practice enterprise scrum, but rather a repository of individual approaches (branches) to integrating scrum with IT, PMO, and other domains of corporate partnership.  

 The LA template is a file named 'Template-main' and lists seven bullet points that may be used as a starting place to describe and share a directors approach to agile scrum within a known use-case or example organization. 

To whatever extent a director, consultant, or leader addresses, interprets, or applies the sections of the template, they become an author of an academic or working branch of liquid agile posted on GitHub. That branch may be private to your own organization, your local desktop, or published here (see how to below) which results in a publicly shared managerial strategy.   

There are currently two types of publicaly shared branches, academic and working. The distinction is made by the branch author when completing the template. Academnic branches have not been in enterprise use and working branches have been or are in enterprise use. 


##### How To Submit Your Own Branch
To create a branch, there are several methods. For those comfortable with version control you can clone the repo to your local machine. You can then edit the Template-main file as you wish. The content is yours to do as you with as you wish, you can manage it just for yourself or you can do a pull request to get your branch published on the public GitHub LA repo. 

Another approach is to open Template-main in your browser and click edit to see edit and download options. 

Last but not least, you can engage a real person to assist with several other options and learn which might be best for your technical level. That real person engagement can be done by clicking on Issues link above or by chatting on this Twitter link.  

 

##### Working Branch Example
LA Matterhorn is a github published working branch that may be helpful to use as a reference for ideas as you construct your own branch.
