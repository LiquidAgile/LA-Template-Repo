> _Liquid Agile is a managerial template for IT and PMO Directors. It is based on the idea that different organizations, leaders, and teams, have ever-evolving trials, needs, and approaches to agile scrum. This space welcomes your ideas, your experiments, your kind support of others, and your ability to hear feedback while steering your own journey._

**Context**
- Agile is 'an ability...'
- Scrum is 'a framework...' 
- LA is 'a template, for all of the above'

When a director, leader, academic, or scrum practitioner completes the LA template and publishes their own branch, they are then on record as an author of a branch (e.g. LA working branch). If that branch is here on GitHub, peer review is welcome, with the mindset of sharing, helping and continuously improving a complex leadership responsibility. 

**Summary of (LA)**
Liquid Agile (LA) is an agile leadership template maintained on this GitHub site. LA is not a recommendation or instruction on how to practice or manage enterprise scrum, but rather a repository of individual manager approaches to integrating scrum with IT, PMO, and other domains of corporate partnership. It is this act of sharing that is much appreciated and valued.  

 The LA template lists seven bullet points that may be used to describe and share a directors approach to integrating and or managing agile scrum within an organization. 

To whatever extent a director, consultant, or leader addresses, interprets, or applies the sections of the template, they become an author of an academic or working branch of liquid agile. That branch may be private to your own organization, desktop repo, or published here via a pull request, resulting in a publicly shared managerial strategy.   

There are currently two types of publicaly shared branches, academic and working. The distinction is made by the branch author when completing the template. Academnic branches have not been in enterprise use and working branches have been or are in enterprise use. 

To create a branch, Git Pull the Template-main branch and edit it to best communicate your practiced execution of agile scrum. When completed do a pull request or contact this repo maintainer/admin either here or on twitter for assistance. 

 








**Working Branch Example**
LA Matterhorn is a github published working branch that may be helpful to use as a reference for ideas on your own branch.
